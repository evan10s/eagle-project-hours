# EagleProjectHours

Eagle Project Hours Calculator (EPHC) lets you quickly and accurately calculate the total hours worked during your Eagle Scout project.  When you're done, you'll have all the information you need to accurately report the hours worked in your project write-up and to make sure your helpers receive service hours for their efforts.

**New**: Good news!  If you run this project locally on your computer, it should work!  A version of EPHC may also be hosted using GitHub Pages in the near future (July or August 2017).

~~There's no need to download these files to your computer.  To use the calculator, go to [future location of url].~~

Note: EPHC stores all entered information (names, times, etc.) locally.  This means that any information you enter will **never** be shared with the developer(s) of EPHC unless you specifically choose to share it.  However, this also means that if you close the browser tab or window that EPHC is open in, you'll lose all of the information you entered.

No software project is done alone, and EPHC is no exception.  Below is a sampling of some of the resources I found most helpful, but you'll also find some more links interspersed throughout the code:
- [The Angular docs](https://angular.io/docs)
- [Project Clarity](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/)

EPHC also uses a number of open source libraries from NPM.  I'm still figuring out how to get a list of all those libraries.  The basic ones, however are:
 - Angular
 - Project Clarity

If you think there's a bug or missing feature and you're familiar with the Angular web framework, here's information about how to contribute to this project and run the code locally on your computer:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
